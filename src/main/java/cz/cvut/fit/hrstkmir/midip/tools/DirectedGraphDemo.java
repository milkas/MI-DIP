/**
 * This class demonstrates some of the operations that can be performed on
 * directed graphs. After constructing a basic directed graph, it computes all
 * the strongly connected components of this graph. It then finds the shortest
 * path from one vertex to another using Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm.
 * The sample code should help to clarify to users of JGraphT that the class
 * org.jgrapht.alg.DijkstraShortestPath can be used to find shortest paths
 * within directed graphs.
